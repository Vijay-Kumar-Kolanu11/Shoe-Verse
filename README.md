üåê Futures of Shoe-Verse</h1>

The future of Shoe-Verse is to grow from a static front-end project into a complete online shoe store. It can be expanded into a fully functional e-commerce platform where users can explore products, add them to their cart, and place orders seamlessly. With backend integration and deployment, Shoe-Verse can evolve into a real-world shopping solution.


<h1>üé® Styles, Layout, & UX Features</h1>

These are stylistic and user-experience related elements I noticed:

Use of CSS styling to define fonts, colors, spacing, alignment. 
GitHub

Likely usage of media queries (or CSS responsive techniques) to adjust layout on different screen sizes (mobile, tablet). 
GitHub

Clean layout: assets folder for images, separation of concerns (HTML for structure, CSS for styling, JS for behavior). 
GitHub

Simple UI, minimal design approach (no heavy frameworks visible). 
GitHub


<h1>‚öôÔ∏è Functionalities</h1>

Here are the features / functions you‚Äôve added:

Shopping Cart: Users can add items to a cart. The JS tracks what the user adds. 


Contact / Input Form: There is a form (likely to capture user input, contact details etc.). 


Responsive Design: The site adapts for mobile and tablet views (via CSS) so that layout adjusts. 


Navigation / UI Buttons: There are clickable buttons (e.g. ‚ÄúAdd to cart‚Äù, Submit) etc.
